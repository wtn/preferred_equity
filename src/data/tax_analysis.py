"""
Tax and Yield Agent for Preferred Equity Analysis.

Classifies Qualified Dividend Income (QDI) eligibility, computes
tax-equivalent yields for a given investor tax bracket, and compares
after-tax income across instruments.

Key concepts:
  - QDI eligibility: dividends from domestic C-corporations that meet the
    holding period requirement are generally taxed at the long-term capital
    gains rate (0%, 15%, or 20%) rather than the ordinary income rate.
    REIT dividends, trust-issued preferreds, and most foreign-issuer
    preferreds do NOT qualify for QDI.
  - Tax-equivalent yield (TEY): the pre-tax yield an investor would need
    from a fully-taxable instrument to match the after-tax income of a
    QDI-eligible preferred.
  - After-tax yield: the yield remaining after applying the appropriate
    tax rate to the dividend income.

This agent uses prospectus terms and issuer characteristics to make the
QDI determination. It does not provide tax advice.
